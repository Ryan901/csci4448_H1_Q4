The program  then a number of display the a random number of randomly created shapes it will print the number of shapes then a 
number of draw messages and then print a table of the shapes sorted in order by z-valuei felt the table made it easier to see 
that the shapes were indeed sorted.
Notes:
    1. I assumed that positive-z was into the screen and negative-z was out of the screen.
       Hence shapes at higher z values are behind shapes at lower z values.
    2. The program generates a random number of random shapes each time it is run.
